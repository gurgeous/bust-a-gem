# Bust A Gem for VS Code

The Bust A Gem extension adds **"Go to Definition"** for Ruby projects in VS Code. It will create a TAGS file using the [ripper-tags](https://github.com/tmm1/ripper-tags) gem, and then use the tags for Go to Definition. Fast and easy.

Bust A Gem provides two additional handy features:

- An **"Open Gem..."** command for quickly opening a gem from your Gemfile. This opens a new window in VS Code.
- Limited support for **"Go to Symbol in File..."** for Ruby projects.

Note: Bust A Gem relies on bundler and only works with Ruby projects that have a `Gemfile`.

## Installation

First, install the extension through VS Code extensions. Search for Bust A Gem.

Second, Bust A Gem uses the excellent [ripper-tags](https://github.com/tmm1/ripper-tags) gem to build a TAGS file for your project. Open an Integrated Terminal in VS Code (using `View > Integrated Terminal`) and run `gem install ripper-tags`. That should put ripper-tags into a spot where VS Code can spawn it. If you are still getting errors about ripper-tags, use `Help > Toggle Developer Tools` to see more debug info.

#### Alternate ripper-tags installation

Add `gem ripper-tags` to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`. In VS Code Settings, set `bustagem.cmd.rip` to `bundle exec ripper-tags -f TAGS -R --force --extra=q` to use bundler.

## Ripping

The first time you use **"Go to Definition"**, Bust A Gem will use ripper-tags to create a `TAGS` file for your project.

Bust A Gem initially just indexes your project. You can also index some of your gem dependencies, which makes it possible to use Go to Definition to jump into a gem. See [Settings](#settings).

Bust A Gem doesn't rebuild TAGS automatically. Use the **"Rebuild"** command to rebuild the TAGS File. You'll want to do this periodically as you work on your project, or after a change to Bust A Gem settings.

## Settings

Initially, Bust A Gem will only index files in your workspace. Add gem names to `bustagem.gems` to instruct Bust A Gem to add some of your gems to the TAGS file. Bust A Gem uses bundler and your Gemfile to find those gems. Don't forget to run **"Rebuild"** to rebuild the TAGS file!

For advanced usage, skip `bustagem.gems` and set `bustagem.cmd.rip` to rip the gems you want. This is a better choice if you use multiple workspaces. For example, to rip all gems from your Gemfile:

`ripper-tags -f TAGS -R --force --extra=q $(bundle show --paths)`

Or a subset (if present):

`ripper-tags -f TAGS -R --force --extra=q $(bundle show --paths | grep -E "(activeadmin|shopify|webflow)")`

See [#18](https://github.com/gurgeous/bust-a-gem/issues/18) for details.

| bustagem.gems       | `[ "activerecord", "devise", ... ]` | List of gems to index for the TAGS file. |

| bustagem.cmd.rip    | `"ripper-tags -f TAGS -R ..."`      | Command used to create the TAGS file.    |

## Caveats and Troubleshooting

A few notes from my experience so far:

- Make sure VS Code can spawn ripper-tags. If you can't run ripper-tags from the VS Code Integrated Terminal, Bust A Gem can't either. See [Installation](#installation).

- Not tested on Linux or Windows.

- Bust A Gem relies on bundler to list gems and figure out gem paths. Investigate `bundler show --paths` in your project if you can't get one of your gems to work.

- ripper-tags is fast. It only takes a second or two to rebuild TAGS for my project. If this is too slow for your needs, you may be able to switch to `ctags -e ...` using the `bustagem.cmd.rip` setting. ripper-tags is much better at ripping Ruby files. For example, ripper-tags indexes Ruby method aliases and ctags does not. But ctags is faster.
